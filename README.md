# lstatus

_lstatus_ is (supposed to be) a simple helper to tool to fetch certain trivial info on your Linux* system.

Following loosely the [Suckless](https://suckless.org) philosophy, _lstatus_ is configured by changing the values inside the `config.h` header and recompiling it.

(*) Yes, only Linux is supported so far, mostly due to my familiarity and _lstatus_'s heavy reliance on the system's directory structure.

## Why?
Why not?

Seriouly though, I had the idea to build this when, while tinkering with `dwmstatus`, I realized how much work goes into solutions like it.
